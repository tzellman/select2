    Can I load data into Select2 using an array?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Yes, but only when you are initially creating it.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What properties are required on the objects passed in to the array?
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    How should nested results be formatted?
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    How many levels of nesting are allowed?
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    Why are <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> tags being created?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The <code>data</code> option is a shortcut that Select2 provides which allows you to load options into your <code>select</code> from a data array.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    My objects don&apos;t use <code>id</code> for their unique identifiers, what can I do?
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    My objects use a property other than <code>text</code> for the text that needs to be displayed
  </h3>
